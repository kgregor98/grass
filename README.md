## What's Grass?
Grass allows you to earn passive income by sharing your network bandwidth

## How to get started?
1. Register a Grass Account if you don't have one already: [getgrass.io](https://app.getgrass.io/register/?referralCode=VqlevN7hfQLGGiQ)
2. Either build this image from source, or download it from Docker Hub
3. Set envriomental variables to their respective values: GRASS_USER and GRASS_PASS

docker run -d \
